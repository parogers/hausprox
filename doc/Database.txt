RFID card data
--------------

Haus|prox supports cards that are based on the 26-bit Weigand open 
card format. The data returned by these cards includes:

* Starting parity bit
* 8-bit facility code
* 16-bit card number
* Trailing parity bit

You can find some general information about various card formats

Database Format
---------------

The card database is stored on an SD card in a file called "cards.txt".
This is a plain-text file with lines of fixed length, one record per 
line. Each line must be exactly 12 bytes long (including newline) 
with the format:

	<facility>-<card>,<enabled><newline>

Where:

	<facility> = three digit facility code, zero padded if needed
	<card> = five digit card number
	<enabled> = 1 or 0 indicating whether the card has access
	<newline> = new-line character (ie ascii char #10)

Example:
 
	123-45678,1

Deleting records
----------------

Because of memory limitations it is not feasible to read the entire 
card database into memory at once. That makes deleting records tricky.
Instead records are marked (the serial number is filled with the 
character 'Z') to indicate they may be freely overwritten.
