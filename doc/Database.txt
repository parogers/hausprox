Database Format
---------------

The card database is stored on an SD card in a file called "cards.txt".
This is a plain-text file with lines of fixed length, one record per 
line. Each line must be exactly 12 bytes long (including newline) 
with the format:

	<facility>-<card>,<enabled><newline>

Where:

	<facility> = three digit facility code, zero padded if needed
	<card> = five digit card number
	<enabled> = 1 or 0 indicating whether the card has access
	<newline> = new-line character (ie ascii char #10)

Example:
 
	123-45678,1
